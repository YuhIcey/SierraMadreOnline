# SierraMadreOnline



The SierraMadre online is a Fallout Multiplayer mod that uses Fallout 3 and NV with the Van Buren Mod. 





This mod will be made by - YuhIcey as a college project and will be free of use after the first version can be made only the server code will be released and the SDK of the actual Project until a later date }



I will just be showing off the source code and inspiring people. 

I am not using the NVMP SDK or the VaultMP this is a fresh slate.
