# SierraMadre Online

Welcome to **SierraMadre Online**, a multiplayer mod for the Fallout series, specifically built upon the engines of **Fallout 3** and **Fallout: New Vegas**. This project integrates features from the **Van Buren Mod**, creating a unique online experience for fans of the Fallout universe.

## Overview

SierraMadre Online is being developed by YuhIcey as a college project. The goal is to bring players together in a collaborative, immersive Fallout experience, allowing them to explore the wasteland, complete quests, and interact with each other in real-time. 

### Key Features
- Fully multiplayer experience set in the Fallout universe.
- Integration with essential elements from Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and the Van Buren Mod.
- Designed from the ground up to provide a fresh, engaging gameplay experience without the reliance on existing multiplayer SDKs (e.g., NVMP, VaultMP).
- The mod will be free after the initial version is released, promoting a community-driven approach.

## Development Intentions

This mod is under active development and will be released in stages:
1. **Pre-Alpha**: Initial release with basic server functionality and core multiplayer features.
2. **Alpha**: Further enhancements to gameplay mechanics, stability improvements, and additional content.
3. **Beta**: Wider testing and community feedback phase.
4. **Final Release**: A polished version, ready for general play.

### Future Releases
The server code will be released upon completion of the first version, allowing other developers and modders to build upon the foundation we create. The full SDK for the project will be available at a later date, enabling further modding possibilities within the SierraMadre Online ecosystem.
